# Straw Hats Classifier

This project is an image classifier that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify characters from the anime One Piece. The model was trained on a dataset containing 650 images of each of the 10 main characters (Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Usopp, Chopper, Robin, Brook, Franky, Jinbei).

The dataset used is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ibrahimserouis99/one-piece-image-classifier).

I am the author of the project and it is available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mariemerenc/Straw-Hats-Classifier).
